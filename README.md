## Description
<h1 align="center"><img src="./logos-defi-insa.svg" height="500"></h1>
This is our repository for the  5th edition of the so-called Défi IA.

This edition of the Défi IA pertains to NLP. The task is straightforward: assign the correct job category to a job description. This is thus a multi-class classification task with 28 classes to choose from.

### Data
The data has been retrieved from CommonCrawl. The latter has been famously used to train OpenAI's GPT-3 model. The data is therefore representative of what can be found on the English speaking part of the Internet, and thus contains a certain amount of bias. One of the goals of this competition is to design a solution that is both accurate as well as fair, as explained in the Evaluation section.


### Evaluation

The original aspect of this competition is that there will be 3 tracks on which solutions will be ranked. First of all, solutions are ranked according to the Macro F1 metric, which will be used to build the [Kaggle leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/defi-ia-insa-toulouse/leaderboard). The Macro F1 score is simply the arithmetic average of the F1 score for each class.
